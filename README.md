# Oasis-infobyte-python-internship



## Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte** as a **Python Developer** and I have developed the following Projects -:
1. A **Chat Application** with a basic server setup.
2. A **Voice Assistant** for executing voice commands.
3. A **Weather App** to fetch real-time weather updates.

## Features

### 1. Chat Application
- Implements a basic client-server architecture.
- Allows real-time text communication between multiple users.
- Utilizes Python's `socket` library for network communication.

### 2. Voice Assistant
- Listens to and processes voice commands.
- Supports functionalities like fetching information, opening applications, and more.
- Built using Python's `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries.

### 3. Weather App
- Fetches live weather data for a given location.
- Uses APIs like OpenWeatherMap to retrieve information.
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Socket Programming**: For chat application.
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap for weather data.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `socket` for networking
  - `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` for voice assistant
  - `requests` for API calls
